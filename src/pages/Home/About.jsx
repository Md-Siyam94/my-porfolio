            <h1 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-4'> Programming Journy</h1>
            <p className=' opacity-70'>My journey as a programmer has been one of passion, curiosity, and relentless learning. From the moment I wrote my first line of code, I knew I was stepping into a world filled with endless possibilities. I started with small projects, experimenting with different technologies and gradually building my skills. <br /> As I delved deeper into web development, I found my place in the MERN stack, which has become my go-to for creating dynamic and responsive applications. Mastering React.js on the frontend, Express.js for seamless backend operations, and MongoDB for efficient data management has been both challenging and rewarding.</p>
